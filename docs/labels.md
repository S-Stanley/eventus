# Labels used at Eventus :label:
At Eventus, we use labels to categorize and keep up with issues and pull requests.

We use these labels to mainly help our reviewers/maintainers review our work and also, these labels keep our **eventus** repository organized.

## Issue labels
For keeping the issues in a systematic way, we use labels which describe the type of issue, goal of the issue, and so on.
Some of the most used labels are:-

* ` adm ` -> This label refer every request related to product and administration (for example getting stats about users retention, growth etc..).
* ` bug ` -> something is wrong and such issue must be fix now. :bug:
* ` documentation ` -> This label tells that a certain feature lacks proper documentation or needs more documents. :orange_book:
* ` duplicate ` -> This label confirm the issue or pull request is already exists.
* ` feature ` -> This label explains that the issue is for improving upon one of our existing features or code. :bulb:
* ` good first issue ` -> These issues are meant for new comers. :tada: :smiley:
* ` help-wanted ` -> This label indicates the issue requires help by anyone willing to contribute.
* ` incorrect ` -> This label indicates something is not working as expected.
* ` marketing ` -> This label is related to eventus identity (e.g picture and screenshot on playstore) or lead generation (like community management).
* ` need exploration ` -> issues that need a bit of time and exploration.
* ` need-spec ` -> These labes indicates those issues without [specificities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)), when we need to create todo's on how to fix an issue.
* ` question ` -> issues that need discussion and requirements need to be elucidated. :brain:
* ` security` -> issues that addresses security related problems.
* ` tech debt ` -> is everything that is missing in the code to met technical standard for example, merging a pull request on a new feature and didn't write test. A new issues with this label will be created to write tests for this feature, and the label will be tech-debts.
* ` tech-only ` -> These labeled issues are for geeks. It does not improve the users experience of the product nor the technical standards, but it's cool to have it as a developer.
* ` UX ` ->  issues related to improve user experience and ergonomy.
* ` wontfix ` -> this will not be worked on.
